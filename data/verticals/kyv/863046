dressing for the office, especially for the upcoming warmer months, can be stressful and time consuming. millennials, especially young women starting out, can have a tougher time deciphering so many different dress codes - they want to dress properly for the office without losing their sense of style.often, the rules on how to dress for work can get a bit blurry. office environments are all over the place  from creative to business casual to professional. and even then, depending on the particular companys culture, those guidelines vary.new york-based stylist and owner of bu style, natalie tincher, says shes seen the struggle first hand. i think some of the challenges stem from work dress codes being less defined. millennials are given more freedom, which can be great for self-expression, but more freedom also comes with a lack of direction. and if youve had limited exposure to office environments or proper instruction, it can be easy to miss the mark.a good rule of thumb when entering a new office environment is to play the dress code safe until you can observe what others wear, tincher says. dressing too casual in any dress code can send a message that you dont care or that you think you are above the rules. always dress your best within any of the defined dress codes. take care to stay groomed and make sure your clothing isnt wrinkled or unkempt, tincher adds.dressing for business casualtincher advises clients to take into account the particular industry when dressing business casual. for example, business casual tends to skew more on the business side of work wear in traditionally corporate industries like finance and law. chinos would be acceptable but never denim, tincher says.in more creative industries like advertising or public relations, business casual can lean more toward the casual end of the spectrum. nice jeans would be appropriate business casual in less corporate industries. tincher calls this, smart casual wear. its a step up from casual and a step down from business casual, she says.in order to bring these looks to life, i enlisted the help of stylist valerie halfon, the founder and ceo of shop with val to curate a few looks on millennial women. here are some seasonally-appropriate outfits for this spring and summer for each industry type and her comments on each. with plenty of business casual options to save you
