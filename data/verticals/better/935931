were trying a new video advice series around everyday dilemmas: friendship, grieving, dating, awkward situations in general, and more. but instead of your typical advice column, we want you to ask the questions and answer them. hear directly from people around the country who are going through the same thing you are.so, heres the first question:send your advice as a video message to crowdsourced@nbcuni.com or share your thoughts as a written message in the form below.
