runners love fall, however, it is inevitable that getting the clothing right on those first few cooler runs takes some trial and error. was it the long-sleeved zip tee or the short-sleeve with arm warmer combo that works best when its 50 degrees? capris or shorts?experienced runners like colorado-based amanda brooks, author of \"run to the finish\", and new england-based allie burdick,
