today, women are leading more companies than at any other time in history (though theres still room for more!). but before they rose to the office of ceo, all of them, at some point, had to land their first job  and ask for a promotion or raise.heres how five female ceos did it and some of their best advice for everyone else on a journey to leadership.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]i learned how to network.megan driscoll, ceo and founder of evolvemkd public relations firmthe greatest thing ive done at the start of (and during) my career is networking. people ive met over the years have recommended me for jobs, become clients and even mentors. ive been given many opportunities that i wouldnt have experienced otherwise.her advice: if youre just starting out, i would recommend reaching out to your alumni networks or internship bosses. when someone is willing to give you their time, come prepared with questions that you cannot find answers to on the internet. showing up informed, prepared and engaged will go a long way. dont forget that informational interviews can lead to jobs![[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]i realized i was underpaid and asked for more money.christa quarles, ceo of opentable, the worlds largest provider of online restaurant reservationsi had been told by many people over the years that it wasnt appropriate to ask for more money, which is crazy, but you internalize these things. in one of my first jobs, i rose quickly through the ranks, but i knew that my salary had not kept up with my title. i didnt know exactly how far off my compensation was, but i knew it was off. i went in to my boss and i said, i am not getting paid relative to my rank, and this is unacceptable. he looked at my salary and i ended up getting more money. i realized then that negotiating for yourself is just another way of doing business, and ive been a negotiator ever since. ive actually been told that i over-negotiate, but i dont think i would be told that if i were a man.her advice: understand the objective measures of your value and be able to negotiate directly around what you bring to the table. how many customers did you deliver? how much did you increase profits? open your discussion with those remarks.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]i decided to never compromise who i am.janice bryant howroyd, founder ceo of the actone group, the largest woman-owned human resources solutions firm in the countryevery conversation leaves a footprint. so, never compromise who you are personally to become who you wish to be professionally. it was the teaching of my mom and dad  who were very invested in my life  that framed that type of thinking. then, once i became invested in my business, i learned that its really true. weve all heard the advice, to thine own self be true, and its essential if you want to be able to lay your head down well and get a good nights sleep. it matters who you are, in all aspects of your life.her advice: if you arent being true to yourself, eventually, one (or more) of your facades are going to crack. my father always said that what you do in the dark will always come to light  and he said that before we even knew what a cell phone was.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]i learned how to lead the discussion about my promotion by making it less about me.autumn manning, co-founder and ceo of youearnedit, an austin, tx- based human resources technology companywhen i went in to ask for my first raise, i knew that my getting it had nothing to do with how much i deserved it. i needed to show how id delivered value to the company. i learned to talk about the things that i uniquely provided that no one else did, which made conversations around promotions factual, not emotional. i want to have a conversation about my title, sounds very different from ive been here for a year and i deserve a promotion. no one likes emotionally-loaded discussions, which is why talking about what youve done  not what you want is such a great approach.her advice: these conversations can be uncomfortable, no matter how prepared you are. its a good idea to put all of your metrics on paper and pretend like youre having a business conversation (which, by the way, you are.)[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]i asked for additional opportunities.beth gerstein, co-founder and co-ceo of brilliant earth, an ethically sourced bridal and fine jewelry companyi was always super focused on how i could be most effective. once i had proven myself in one area of my work, i would ask for additional projects. when you do a bit more, and go above and beyond expectations, thats going to amplify your success. admittedly, it may be easier to take on different types of work at a smaller company, but anytime you can show youre interested in the bigger picture and able to do more, its a good thing.her advice: try to have a curiosity broader than your current role and figure out ways that you can add value outside of your day-to-day responsibilities. keep in mind, though, that the number one thing you have to do is demonstrate mastery in the job youre being paid to do now. only once youve done that should you demonstrate how youd like to take on more.with kathryn tuggletake your career to the next level4 easy social media updates that will give your career a boosthow to build a work wardrobe on a budgethow to ask for a raise (and get one)4 key steps to finding  and snagging  your dream job10 skills you already have that can reinvent your careerwant more tips like these?
