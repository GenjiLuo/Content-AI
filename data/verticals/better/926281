last week, a half a bag of grapes, a container of homemade soup and a few rogue radishes i found buried at the bottom of the produce drawer all ended up in my garbage. it pains me to see produce tied up in a garbage bag for multiple reasons: im well aware of how many people dont have easy access to all of the produce i conveniently pick up on my walk home from work; i could have used those ingredients to create healthy meals; and i also see dollar signs going right into the garbage can along with my wilting kale and mushy zucchini.im not alone: in the united states, 31 percent of the available food supply at the retail and consumer levels in 2010 went uneaten. and those of us who eat a healthy diet are some of the biggest culprits: a study published in the journal plos one found that the healthiest americans are the most wasteful, because of their high consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are frequently thrown out.while there are a confluence of factors that affect food waste, one that we have direct control over is how much we are throwing away in our own households. and i, for one, know that the organization of my fridge (or, the lack thereof) is largely to blame for my own waste. i bring home my grocery store haul and shove everything into drawers and stack them on shelves, without much rhyme or reason. and without fail on a weekly basis there is a slimy bag of greens or a half-eaten jar of tomato sauce with questionable coloring that was shoved into the back and forgotten and has to be tossed.certainly taking the time to put a better system in place could make a huge difference, but if my closets are any indication, my home organization skills are wanting. so i called in reinforcements.gilat tunit, founder of project neat, a professional home organization company, says that establishing an organization system in your refrigerator is as simple as investing in a few affordable products that will make your fridge more efficient by maximizing space.the goal is to contain items, categorize them and separate them, says tunit. its really important in a fridge to be able to access things. what happens to most when [storing food is] you have to move one thing out of the way to get to the other things. how many times do you open your fridge and have to pull out the entire fridge just to reach the dressing all the way in the back? we are all guilty of that process, but its not our fault! the options that the fridge comes with is the issue in itself. its basically open shelving and no real direction as to what should go where. but what many people dont realize is that were not stuck working with the structure our particular fridge allots us.[the fridge] is the last place one imagines a possibility for organization. we assume that our fridge will just always be messy because its used on such a consistent basis. says tunit. [people] also dont realize how inexpensive it can be to make it organized and much more functional. a lot of times the products we can use to keep a fridge organized are the same as what we would use in a different part of our home.ready to give your own fridge a makeover? tunit shares her affordable, product picks that will make every fridge more efficient  and make it easier to stock up on healthy ingredients (without any of them ending up in the trash).better editors, writers and experts take care to recommend items we really like and hope youll enjoy! just so you know, better does have affiliate relationships. so, while every product is independently selected, if you buy something through our links, we may get a small share of the revenue.mdesign divided lazy susan storage container[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]price: $17.99 per container, amazonwhat to store: butter, sour cream, cream cheese, syrup, cottage cheesetunit calls this product a must have in every home. \"the use of products such as a lazy susan gives you the ability to actually see everything that you have, she says. i suggest this for everything and anything: whether its your fridge or your pantry or your makeup or kids crayons. in my fridge i use it for condiments. theres no rummaging, no moving things out of the way, you spin it and grab whatever you need. people think if they have a lot of stuff, they cant organize it, but thats not true. as long as you contain it and have everything categorized, you can have as much stuff as you want and it will still be organized.32-ounce ball mason jars[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]price: $10.35 for set of 12 jars, targetwhat to store: fruit (strawberries, grapes, blueberries, raspberries)i love mason jars for fruit such as strawberries, blueberries and grapes,\" says tunit. \"first of all , they are tall and narrow which doesnt take shelf space. they also seal tight for lasting freshness and they are glass, which is preferable to plastic.bino organizer bin with built-in handle[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]price: $9.99 per bin, amazonwhat to store: produce like peppers, yellow squash, tomatoes, small cucumbersthere are a couple of things i love about these bins: theyre clear so you can see through them;
