here, it stands in for potatoes to make latkes. this swap cuts the carbs and calories, but the recipe also suggests serving the latkes with unsweetened applesauce instead of the traditional sweetened variety and plain 0% greek yogurt in place of sour cream. plus, rather than deep frying the latkes, theyre sauted in a non-stick skillet coated with a spritz of olive oil. taken together, these recipe swaps will save you carbs, calories and sugar, leaving a little room for another chanukah tradition: jelly donuts!slow cooker gingerbread apple pie crumble[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]with a blend of gingerbread spices, apples, and a crispy, crumble topping, this dessert will be at home at thanksgiving and christmas. since its made in a slow cooker, you can multi-task, letting it cook (while the aroma fills your kitchen), as youre making other holiday dishes. since the crumble is made with ultra-healthy ground flaxseed, whole grain oats and pecans, and because the dish is low in added sugars, you could also serve it for a deliciously low-fuss holiday brunch. as a dessert, youll probably want to add a spoonful of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, but if youre going the brunch route, add a spoonful of greek yogurt instead. if you skip the toppings or use dairy free alternatives, this crumble is both vegan and gluten free.healthy baked pears[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]this is one holiday dessert that wont put you in a sugar coma!
