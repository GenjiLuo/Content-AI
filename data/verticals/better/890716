season, they tend to peak in summer and fall, says chrissy carroll, mph, rd and usat level i triathlon coach. this is one superfood that should be in any athletes diet, thanks to their dietary nitrates, a component that increases blood and oxygen flow to the muscles, carroll adds. theres no denying the benefits of beets and their juice, and ample research has linked consumption of beetroot
