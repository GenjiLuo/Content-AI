the answer, according to green, is complicated.one thing that i think happens is a lot of people assume the coworker theyre talking to has the same political views as they do, says green.if a coworker is saying things that offend you, you might fear getting into an argument, or may simply feel awkward. if thats the case, dont be afraid to politely end the conversation, says green.one thing you can do is say, actually, we see this really differently, its not something i want to get into at work, and then just change the subject, she says.maybe you agree with your colleagues politics, but would rather focus on work. if thats the case, let your coworker know you are taking a break from politics right now, advises green.you can say it in a warm, polite way, says green. most people wont take offense.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]read your coworkers cueswhat if youre the one whos chit-chatty about politics?

do they look a little upset or exhausted? are they giving you one-word answers? do they look like theyre trying to escape?even if you think we should all be able to have collegial, civil conversations about whatever political issue you feel like talking about, youve got to respect that your coworkers might not be in the mood for it.pay attention to whether or not people want that, because it can be a very draining environment if you cant ever get away from politics, green says.if a coworker tells you they dont want to talk politics, thats something you need to respect, green stresses. if you and a colleague are having a civil discussion about politics, green says to keep in mind that those around you might not want to hear it.even if you think we should all be able to have collegial, civil conversations about whatever political issue you feel like talking about, youve got to respect that your coworkers might not be in the mood for it, she says.youre not at work to push political viewpointsduring a heated election cycle, some people may be especially eager to talk politics with colleagues. green says this might be fine in some workplace cultures. but understand that telling coworkers who you plan to vote for, or asking them how they plan to vote, can be perceived as crossing boundaries.youre not there to advocate for a candidate, or a particular issue, youre really there to work, she says.green says its also important to understand that decorating your desk or office space with political merchandise and slogans can be viewed as propagandistic.people who are around you at work are a captive audience, says green. its not really fair to inflict campaign propaganda on them when they cant get away from it and when they have to maintain pleasant, cordial relations with you.should you unfollow coworkers on social media?social media is another place where coworkers may be exposed to one anothers political views.while its important for people to be able to express their beliefs on social media, it can also create conflict with coworkers.does this mean you should unfollow coworkers whose views conflict with yours, or censor what you share?
