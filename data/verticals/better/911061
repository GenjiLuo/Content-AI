with the school season back in full swing, its time to start thinking about fueling young minds with healthy snacks. you can always count on fruits and veggies as smart bets, but between sports practice, piano lessons and other after school activities, a packable, non-perishable snack is often needed. before gearing up for your next grocery haul, here are some tips to keep in mind:look for whole food ingredients. the healthiest snacks contain predominantly whole food ingredients, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains (like oats, whole wheat, or sorghum), beans (such as chickpeas or lentils), nuts or seeds, eggs, and others.limit or avoid foods made with artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and flavors. though the fda deems these safe in amounts normally consumed, theyre often a sign that a product is overly processed, and these ingredients dont bring benefits to growing bodies.keep an eye on added sugars. even seemingly healthy snacks, like granola bars and yogurts, may contain excessive amounts of added sugars. food labels list sugar in grams; a teaspoon is about four grams. for the most part, you want to be in the range of a teaspoon or less. one more pointer: some products designed for kids are smaller in size than a comparable product on a nearby shelf. i spotted one popular granola bar brand with a kids bar that listed 5 grams of added sugar  not too bad until i recognized that the bar was only 23 grams in weight. the same flavor of the adult-size bar was also 5 grams of sugar, but its about 50% larger. so proportionally, the adult-size bar packs in less added sugar, and the size is suitable for children and adults.if you want to skip the label reading or need some snack inspiration, here are some of the healthiest snacks to toss in your childs backpack. you can find most of these in your larger grocery chains and superstores like target and walmart  or you can buy in bulk from retailers like amazon.better editors, writers and experts take care to recommend items we really like and hope youll enjoy!
