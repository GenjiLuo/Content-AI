been shopping at any big chain stores lately? if so, youve probably been asked at the checkout counter something like this: would you like to apply for our credit card and get a big discount on todays purchase?for retailers, this is not only prime-time sales, its the peak season for generating new customers. getting you to carry their credit card in your wallet is a perfect way to start a relationship and build brand loyalty.retailers push their store credit cards because they know that if they get somebody to sign up for one of those cards, theyre more likely to come back, and thats what its really all about for them, said matt schulz, chief industry analyst at the website comparecards, a credit card comparison website.some of the offers are mighty enticing:kohls charge card: 35 percent off your first purchase in store or online, plus another 15 percent discount when your card arrives in the mail.rei co-op mastercard: a $100 gift card when you make a purchase within the first 60 days of getting the card.the home depot consumer credit card: a $100 discount on a purchase of $1,000 or more within the first 30 days.amazon prime rewards visa signature card: a $70 amazon gift card immediately upon approval.keep in mind: interest rates on most store cards are significantly higher than other credit cards. a recent study by comparecards looked at credit cards from 50 of the nations largest retailers and found that:the average annual percentage rate (apr) for a store credit card is nearly 25 percent (24.97 percent), more than eight percentage points higher than the average apr americans pay on other credit card debt  currently 16.46 percent, according to the federal reserve.store cards that can only be used at that specific retailer or family of stores had an average apr of 26.93 percent. co-branded cards (with a visa, mastercard, american express or discover logo) that can be used anywhere had a slightly lower average apr (23.20 percent).retailers say theres a reason why the interest rates on their credit cards are higher  it has to do with increased risk.stores are more willing to give a card to someone with untested credit than a bank, often on an instant-credit basis, said craig shearman, vice president for public relations at the national retail federation. that means they are taking a larger risk and need to charge more interest to account for that.weighing the pros &amp; the consa store card is clearly good for the retailer, but what about you? it all depends. and its not easy to weigh the pros and cons when youre in a rush.that could explain why nearly half (47 percent) of the people surveyed by comparecards who have opened a store card, eventually regretted getting it. those most likely to have regrets:parents with children under 18generation xthose with household incomes of $100,000 or highera lot of times when you get these cards, youre doing it in a pressure situation at checkout and you dont have a whole lot of time to decide or to look at details, and sometimes you end up making a decision that you regret, schulz said.if youre offered a sizable discount on a significant purchase youre about to make  and you know you can pay off the balance when the statement arrives  it may be worth applying for the card at the register. i did that once and saved a bundle on an expensive winter coat, but i knew i could pay the bill in full when it arrived.you dont have to be an accountant to understand that it doesnt make any sense to pay 25 percent in interest to save 20 percent on a purchase.and there may be other perks, such as special cardholder offers, early access to sales and ongoing rewards.the most lucrative is a higher percentage of cash back, said jill gonzalez, an analyst with wallethub, a personal finance website. right now, that tends to be 5 percent. target has a good card  like that and so does amazon.because retailers tend to have a much easier approval process, a store card can be a good option for someone who cant get a credit card because of no credit or poor credit.by applying for a store credit card, you might be able to start building your credit, said bill hardekopf, ceo of lowcards.com, a card comparison website. if you start slowly building your credit and show the credit bureaus that you are a good risk, either once again or for the first time, store credit cards can offer you that advantage.deferred interest offersmany store cards offer special financing for that initial purchase: no interest for a specified promotional period, typically between 6 to 24 months.these deferred interest offers can be a real money-saver, but theres a big catch you need to know about: fail to pay off the balance in full by the end of the promotional period or make just one late payment and youll get hit with accrued interest on the full purchase price at the stores sky-high interest rate.a single late payment, even if its late by a day, can trigger that interest charge for the entire period of the deferred interest offer  even if youre just a couple months into that deferred interest period  which can really set you back, said john ganotis, founder of credit card insider.lets say you buy a tv for $1,000 and you dont pay off the entire balance by the end of the 12-month interest-free period or miss a payment. assuming the interest rate on that card is 24.97 percent (the average apr for store cards right now) youll be charged nearly $250 in accrued interest.note: you will never pay off the balance by the end of the promotional period, if you only make the minimum monthly payment.study the fine print at homeso what do you do when youre offered an instant discount if you apply for the stores credit card?the smart move is to get a brochure, take it home and review the terms and conditions. the checkout line isnt the place to make financial decisions.that said, if youre going to get a significant discount on a sizable purchase or you regularly shop at that store  and you know you will absolutely pay the bill in full when the statement comes  saying yes might make sense.if you plan to carry a balance, dont even think about applying for that card.you dont have to be an accountant to understand that it doesnt make any sense to pay 25 percent in interest to save 20 percent on a purchase, comparecards schulz said. as good as that offer might sound, if you cant pay, stay away.you can compare store credit cards at comparecards, creditcardinsider, and wallethub.more from betterhow to budget (and get out of debt) if you live paycheck-to-paycheckheres what happens when you miss your credit card paymentsis it time for a new credit card?
