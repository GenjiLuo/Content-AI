when nasas insight lander successfully touched down on mars yesterday, it was the end of a seven-month journey to the red planet. but the landing also marked the beginning of the next phase of the spacecrafts two-year, $850-million mission.now that were on the surface of mars, we have a lot of work to go, elizabeth barrett, who leads the team at nasas jet propulsion laboratory charged with deploying and operating insights instruments, said in a news briefing yesterday after the landing.the first thing well do is assess the health of our spacecraft and the health of the instruments that went with us, and then look at our landing site, she added.the 800-pound lander is parked on a broad plain north of the martian equator known as elysium planitia  a mostly rock-free area that was faintly visible in the first photo sent back from the lander. over the next two to three months, barrett and her team will direct the landers six-foot-long robotic arm to pluck each science instrument from the craft and place it directly on the martian surface.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]i liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but youre doing it with a really, really valuable prize, and youre doing it blindfolded, where you can only take occasional pictures, and then youre doing it via remote control on another planet, barrett said.the team will begin with insights dome-shaped seismometer, which is designed to eavesdrop on mars deep interior, listening in on seismic activity and measuring the frequency and magnitude of marsquakes.about two weeks after the seismometer and its protective shield are in place, the arm will be used to deploy a probe that will hammer itself as far down as 16 feet below the surface. this probe will measure how much heat is coming from deep within the planet.the seismometer and heat probe are designed to give scientists new insights into how mars, earth and other rocky planets formed and evolved.even though insights landing spot is mostly flat, placing the crafts instruments on the surface is a delicate, risky process. but the team at the jet propulsion lab in pasadena, california, will have time to rehearse.we have a test bed here that well actually terraform to look very much like the martian area we land in, and well practice deploying to make sure everything is going to go smoothly, barrett said.once insights instruments are in place, the landers science mission can begin in earnest. at that point, well be sitting back and listening for those marsquakes and measuring the vital signs of mars, barrett said. were really looking forward to that.want more stories about mars?robert zubrin wants to establish a new branch of civilization on marsheres what future mars and lunar space colonies could look likea lake on mars? discovery of liquid water below planets surface stokes hopes of finding lifefollow nbc news mach on twitter, facebook, and instagram.
