researchers in japan have developed a \"telepresence\" system that lets one person remotely control a set of robotic arms attached to a backpack worn by another person, effectively allowing two people to work together on complex tasks without being in the same place.developed at keio university and the university of tokyo, the prototype system consists of a set of human-like robotic arms and a robotic \"head\" equipped with stereo vision and microphones, all attached to a backpack, which contains control circuitry and a battery.real-time data from the robotic head is beamed to a virtual reality headset worn by the other person, who manipulates handheld controllers to operate the robotic arms.\"thus the user can feel as being fused with the surrogate body, and therefore both can share their actions,\" mhd yamen saraiji, an assistant professor at keio university and one of the researchers who developed the system, told nbc news mach in an email.the \"fusion\" system, presented last month at a computer graphics conference in vancouver, canada, allows an expert in one location to guide someone in another  for example, showing how to assemble something or giving instruction in the operation of tools or instruments.the robotic hands can be removed and the robotic wrists temporarily fixed to the surrogates own wrists to give the user complete control  an arrangement that could be used to teach someone to play a musical instrument, for example.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]\"there are also potential applications in assistive robotics, for example, by providing extra support or coordination to someone with a motor impairment like weakness or a tremor,\" henny admoni, an assistant professor at carnegie mellon universitys robotics institute, told mach in an email. \"the potentially provocative aspect of this robot,\" she added, \"is that its designed to also allow a remote operator to physically guide the wearer.\"this isnt the first supplemental arm system that has been developed. in 2014 researchers at the georgia institute of technology demonstrated a wearable third arm that could play the drums, and last year researchers at cornell university unveiled a third arm that could assist with a variety of tasks. but unlike the fusion systems arms, these other arms werent designed to be controlled by a remote user.saraiji said the researchers hope to create a commercial version of the fusion system once more development and testing are completed. but given the complexities, admoni said she would be surprised if it became a commercial technology \"anytime soon.\"want more stories about robotics?11 cool robots to know about nowwhy this blind, catlike robot could transform search and rescuethese tiny robots could be disease-fighting machines inside the bodyfollow nbc news mach on twitter, facebook, and instagram.
