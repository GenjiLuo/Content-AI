nasas opportunity rover on mars did not return a call from earth yesterday (june 12) while enduring a massive dust storm that scientists have called \"one of the most intense ever observed.\"\"the martian dust storm that has blotted out the sun above opportunity has continued to intensify,\" nasa officials wrote in a mission update tuesday. \"the storm, which was first detected on may 30, now blankets 14 million square miles (35 million square kilometers) of martian surface  a quarter of the planet.\" that means opportunitys solar panels arent getting enough sunlight to phone home from its perseverance valley location on mars.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]opportunitys failure to reply to a signal from its mission operations center at nasas jet propulsion laboratory is a sign the rover has entered a \"low power fault mode\" in which all the rovers systems shut down except for a mission clock. that clock is programmed to wake up the rover periodically and check its power levels to see if it can call home. [the greatest mars discoveries by opportunity &amp; spirit]\"if the rovers computer determines that its batteries dont have enough charge, it will again put itself back to sleep,\" nasa officials said. \"due to an extreme amount of dust over perseverance valley, mission engineers believe it is unlikely the rover has enough sunlight to charge back up for at least the next several days.\"the dust storm was first spotted on may 30 by nasas mars reconnaissance orbiter, and it has been growing ever since. nasa has continued to track the storm from orbit and the surface. in addition to opportunity, the mars rover curiosity is monitoring dust levels from the storm.scientists think the power level in opportunitys batteries is below 24 volts. if the rover loses power for an extended amount of time, there is a chance it wont be able to power the heaters needed to keep its electronics alive. the extreme cold of mars is thought to be what killed opportunitys twin, the spirit rover, after it got stuck in martian sand in 2010.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]opportunity has seen its share of dust storms on mars.in 2007, a planetwide dust storm blotted out the sun for two weeks. opportunity went silent during that storm, too, but survived. the nearly 15-year-old rover launched in 2003 and has been exploring mars since it landed in january 2004. opportunity has lasted more than 50 times longer than its original 90-day mission plan, nasa officials have said.nasa will hold a teleconference today at 1:30 p.m. edt (1730 gmt) to discuss the martian dust storm, its impact on opportunity and how scientists are tracking it with spacecraft in orbit. you can watch that news briefing live here on space.com, courtesy of nasa tv.email tariq malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him @tariqjmalik. follow us @spacedotcom, facebook and google+. original article on space.com.the evolution of nasas mars rover tires in picturesred planet express: 10 ways robots move on marshow nasas mars rovers spirit and opportunity work (infographic)want more stories about mars?driving on mars just got safer for curiosity, thanks to a special algorithmnasas insight mission will give mars a long-overdue health checkupwhy robotic bees may be the next visitors to marsfollow nbc news mach on twitter, facebook, and instagram.
