after a journey of almost four years and 2 billion miles, a japanese space probe is closing in on its target, a small asteroid named ryugu, the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) said on sunday.the unmanned craft, hayabusa 2, is scheduled to rendezvous with ryugu on wednesday. plans call for it to survey the half-mile-wide space rock using a suite of instruments, a lander and three tiny robotic rovers before returning to earth with samples of ryugu in november 2020.if the mission succeeds, it will be only the second time that samples of an asteroid have been brought back to earth. other probes, including nasas galileo spacecraft, have visited asteroids, but hayabusa 2s predecessor, hayabusa (the name means \"peregrine falcon\" in japanese), is the only one to have returned to earth  with samples. it brought back bits of the itokawa asteroid in 2010.jaxa says this final leg of the mission will be a tricky one. a tiny mistake can mean you miss the target entirely, elizabeth tasker, an associate professor of solar system science at the agency, told new scientist. the distances are equivalent to trying to hit a 6-centimeter target in brazil from japan.in recent days, hayabusa 2 has beamed back a series of dramatic photos of ryugu, which circles the sun from a distance ranging from just within earths orbit to just outside mars orbit. the latest photo shows a rocky, cratered object against the blackness of space.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]in a post on jaxas website, hayabusa 2 project manager, yuichi tsuda, likened the asteroids strange, multifaceted shape to that of a crystal of the mineral fluorite or an abacus bead. nasa, which designated a set of the new photos its \"astronomy picture of the day\" on monday, said ryugu looked like \"a big space diamond.\"hayabusa 2, which launched into space on dec. 3, 2014, isnt the only space probe now en route to an asteroid. nasas osiris-rex probe launched on sept. 8, 2016, and is scheduled to reach its target, the asteroid bennu, in december. plans call for osiris-rex to return samples to earth in 2023.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]\"the two missions are very similar,\" paul chodas, manager of the center for near earth object studies at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena, california, told nbc news mach in an email. \"scientists will be interested to see whether the composition of bennu differs in any way from that of ryugu.\"carbon-containing asteroids like ryugu have attracted interest in part because theyre thought to harbor water-bearing minerals that may hold clues about the origin and evolution of our solar system. whats more, chodas said, \"it is possible that we may someday extract water or oxygen from asteroids like ryugu, which means they could be used as refueling stops for missions on the way to mars.\"ryugu, which means \"dragons palace\" in japanese, was discovered in 1999 and named in 2015.nasa says no known asteroid poses a significant threat of impact with earth over the next century.want more stories about space rocks?space scientists have big plans to avert an asteroid apocalypseasteroid the size of a city block just gave earth a close shavenasa reveals new plan to stop asteroids before they hit earthfollow nbc news mach on twitter, facebook, and instagram.
