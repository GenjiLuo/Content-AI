nasas first crewed mission to mars may still be years away, but already were getting a glimpse of the sort of habitat that astronauts could use as a staging point for a multimonth voyage to the red planet, an asteroid or another deep-space destination.aerospace giant lockheed martin unveiled an early prototype of its deep-space habitat last week at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida. the cylindrical module  a reworked cargo container from the space shuttle era  is about 22 feet long and 16.5 feet wide. thats much bigger than the russian soyuz capsules that take astronauts to and from the international space station but tiny compared to the space station itself, which is made up of 16 pressurized modules that collectively cover an area bigger than a football field.given the habitats size, life in space will most likely be a bit cramped for the four astronauts who could live there for up to 60 days before shipping out to deep space.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]its a lot like being in an rv, where youre constantly reconfiguring the space, said bill pratt, who manages the deep-space habitat program at lockheed martin. the couch and the table become your bed, and youre constantly moving and shuffling things around.in addition to sleeping quarters, the habitat will have a toilet, exercise equipment, storage space, an area for science experiments and a galley.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]the habitat is designed to form one module of nasas proposed deep space gateway, a miniature space station that would orbit the moon and serve as a way station for lunar missions or journeys deeper into the cosmos.[[,\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":}]]lockheeds prototype is the refurbished donatello cargo container that was originally designed to fit inside the space shuttles cargo bay and ferry supplies to and from the iss. donatello never flew in space, but its two sister modules made several trips aboard the shuttle. one, dubbed leonardo, is now a permanent space closet attached to the space station.lockheed is one of six companies awarded a combined $65-million contract from nasa to design a deep-space habitat as part of the agencys next space technologies for exploration partnerships (nextstep) program, which aims to foster commercial developments for space exploration.boeing, orbital atk, bigelow aerospace, sierra nevada corporations space systems and nanoracks are all working on their own habitats.lockheed plans to complete work on its prototype module in november. early next year, nasa will test and evaluate the various submitted designs.want more stories about human spaceflight?the human factor: what it will take to build the perfect team for traveling to marsgoing to mars will involve all sorts of risks. going bonkers might be the biggest.nasa names nine astronauts for boeing, spacex flights in new era for spaceflightfollow nbc news mach on twitter, facebook, and instagram.
